# VideoTV

A simple Flutter Android project that displays a list of videos fetched from
`https://jable.tv/categories/chinese-subtitle/`. The list is generated by a
Python crawler and stored locally as `video_list.json`. Tapping a video plays
its m3u8 stream using the `video_player` package.

## Getting Started

Install Flutter and the Python dependencies then run the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # once
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

If platform folders are missing, create them with:

```bash
flutter create .
```

Then run `flutter run` again.

On the home screen tap the refresh button in the app bar to run the Python
crawler. It will open a Chrome instance, gather the latest video information and
write `video_list.json` in the app's documents directory. After the crawl
finishes the list will update with thumbnail images and titles.
